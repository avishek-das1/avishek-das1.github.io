I am a Postdoctoral researcher interested in understanding the information processing in soft matter through a synergy between chemical reactions and diffusive self-organization. Currently in the group of [Prof. Pieter Rein ten Wolde](https://amolf.nl/research-groups/biochemical-networks) at AMOLF, Amsterdam, I am exploring how information flow and feedback in biochemical sensory networks constrains bacterial performance during chemotaxis. We seek to rationalize bacterial behavior as autonomous machines navigating fluctuating nutrient gradients by using environmental information most effectively.

During my PhD with [Prof. David Limmer](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/dtlgrp/) at University of California Berkeley, I designed novel numerical paradigms for the optimal control of diffusive nonequilibrium many-body systems . This approach yielded new and efficient algorithms to sample rare fluctuations and reactive events in nonequilibrium simulations, using tools from reinforcement learning. We also developed an inverse design algorithm for the self-assembly of colloids in nonequilibrium conditions, for targeting arbitrary structural and dynamical order parameters.

I have also co-founded a yearly [mathematics bootcamp](https://chemmathbootcamp.com/) for physical chemistry PhD students at UC Berkeley.
