- What makes a collection of chemical reactions into a living organism?

- How do biological cells perceive and manipulate their noisy world?

- How does chemistry and diffusion come together to create _intelligent_ spatiotemporal patterns?

These are the core questions that fuel my research in the information processing of soft and biological matter. I strive to answer these through fundamental theory in statistical physics and information theory, through the development of novel numerical algorithms, and by collaboration with experiments for characterizing and designing intelligent matter.

Currently in my **postdoctoral research** in the group of [Prof. Pieter Rein ten Wolde](https://amolf.nl/research-groups/biochemical-networks) at AMOLF, I am exploring the behavioral similarity between motile bacteria, and synthetic microrobots that would optimally climb up the gradient of a chemical signal. Using the framework of information theory, we are developing novel theoretical, numerical and experimental techniques to quantify the directional information processing in general biochemical networks, and specifically for stochastic navigators. As an end goal we ask: how exactly does information act as a currency in the design of an autonomous navigator? Do biological navigators optimally use their acquired information?

I did my **PhD in Physical (Theoretical) Chemistry** with [Prof. David Limmer](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/dtlgrp/) at the University of California Berkeley. There I designed a novel numerical paradigm, called Variational Path Sampling, for simulating and designing nonequilibrium fluctuations of soft matter. My research synthesized tools from molecular dynamics simulations, large deviation theory in probability, stochastic thermodynamics, and reinforcement learning. We produced several efficient numerical algorithms to sample rare fluctuations, infer reaction rate constants, design self-assembly and create life-life properties in colloids. 

**In the future**, I would like to address how the two fields come together to make soft matter intelligent. Specifically, I would like to study information processing in systems where both reactive and spatial degrees of freedom dynamically carry information. Such systems are ubiquitous in biology and are only starting to be designed _in vitro_. In such systems, the quantification and optimization of the amount of processed information require new theoretical and numerical innovations, due to the wide range of timescales involved. I want to work towards developing those tools, apply them to the experimental characterization of biological systems, and discover the key components to create efficient _Mechano-chemical Computers_.

Besides these directions, I ponder a lot about the rare events that could have led to the origin of life on earth. Another favorite activity of mine is teaching. I have experience as a teaching assistant for several graduate-level physical chemistry courses. I like teaching so much that, after my teaching assistantship was over, I co-founded, designed and taught a yearly [mathematics bootcamp](https://chemmathbootcamp.com/) for physical chemistry PhD students at Berkeley.
